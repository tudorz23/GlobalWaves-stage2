## What is GlobalWaves?
* GlobalWaves is a music and podcast streaming service backend written in the
Java language.
* This is the second stage of the main project, extending the first part, so
the present will mostly focus on the new functionalities, while more details on
the first stage, the basics of the platform and the run procedure can be found
